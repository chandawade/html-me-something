                <h2>Most Important to Know</h2>
                <p>Hello, world! I was born August 10th, 1988.That's right, I'm a Leo, baby. Two things you should know about
                    me, I
                    <em>love</em> food and traveling.
                    <br> What might I enjoy eating?..Good question!</p>

                <p>
                    <b>FOOD!</b> My favorite F word. I can't even begin to describe the joy I have while eating. If I had to
                    choose, I would say my favorite cuisine
                    <br> is Italian food, followed by Seafood, followed by Authentic Mexican food. I think the best advice my
                    mother has given me is to marry the
                    <br> person who gives me the same feeling I get when I see food coming at a restaurant. You're probably wondering,
                    "is that advice she actually
                    <br> follows?" The short answer is, yes! While traveling, I love to try native dishes. Thus far the most
                    interesting food item I've eaten is octopus
                    <br> ..I didn't really like it. Check out my food diary below!</p>

                    <h2>Wanderlust</h2>
                    <p>(n)
                        <em>a strong desire or urge to travel and explore the world</em>
                        <br>• A collector of experiences
                        <br>• Veni Vidi Amavi
                        <br>
                        <br>A definition and a few words to describe my infinity for traveling. Although I am approaching a milestone
                        birthday, year 2017 is the first time I actually lived life. I discovered exploration is the key
                        to growth. If we were meant to stay in one place, we'd have roots instead of feet. I kick started
                        my travel journey with a roadtrip in January 2017, to the "deep" South. I had the pleasure to help
                        coordinate and arrange a tour of five HBCUs for 10 juniors and senior throughout the state of Mississippi
                        and Tennessee. It was an AMAZING experience. My last week of January 2017 was spent in Oahu, Hawaii.
                        Can you say
                        <em>beautiful</em>. I spent 9 hours on a plane to arrive at pure bliss. As expected, I got leid pon arrival
                        (be very jealous)...one of the best feelings ever. Unfortunately, my week long escapade ended entirely
                        too quick. Before I knew it, I was back on a plane routed to St. Louis. My next adventure presented
                        itself in March, to the Lonestar State - Dallas, TX.I spent a jammed-pack week full of expected,
                        and some unexpected, adventures with my sister. The one experience I didn't expect was a trip to
                        the chiropractor. *Lesson-learned, don't be lazy and sleep in the chair; just blow up the air mattress.*
                        I departed from Dallas with a newly aligned neck. It would be a couple of months before my next trip.
                        The month of May called for a two-day all expenses paid trip to...(drum roll please) ASHEBORO, NC.
                        By all expenses paid, I mean, a business trip. I honestly didn't know what to expect, but Asheboro
                        isn't what I expected. The best part of my trip undoubtably was the Cheerwine Soda (pop). Had I had
                        overpacked, as I tend to do, I would have brought some back with me. My next trip was planned a couple
                        weeks prior to travel with a friend to one of my favorite destinations,
                        <em>Puerto Rico</em>. I spent a week on the island drinking as many Miami Vices and Rum Punches as imaginable,
                        eating numerous variations of mofongos, and of course, Octopus. I hiked in the El Yunque Rainforest,
                        boogie boarded for the first time, and bar-hopped with strangers who are now social media buddies.
                        Following Puerto Rico, I found myself visiting Dallas again. This time, for my birthday. Three short
                        weeks afterwards, I would visit the land of romance - Paris, France. OH PARIS! How my soul misses
                        thee. What an experience. Let's see, while I was there, I was fake proposed to in front of the Arc
                        de Triomphe, journeyed to the top of the Eiffel Tower, cruised the Seine River, visted the Louve,
                        consumed way too many carbs and too much wine, and shopped entirely too much to the point I had to
                        pay over $75 in overweight baggage fees (yikes!). Needless to say, I had a grand time.</p>
